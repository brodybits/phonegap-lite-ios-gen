reqs

1. ios sdk
2. [ios-sim](https://github.com/Fingertips/ios-sim)
3. phonegap/iphone - TBD from PG-lite

usage
---

start with the followin steve jobs inspired command:

    ./bin/BOOM

it should create a phoengap/iphone project in the root called `./example`, compile it, launch it in the sim and attach a logger to stout.

from there you could play w/ the other scripts:

    ./bin/BOOM ......................... play with the example app
    ./bin/create [path package name] ... creates a phonegap/iphone project
    ./bin/debug [path name] ............ compile app and launch in the sim
    ./bin/emulate ...................... launch the ios simulator
    ./bin/log [path] ................... console.log to stdout

read the src, send feedback, bugs --- appreciated!
